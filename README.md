The PDF file can be divided in 5 sections:
  1. Chapter 1-2 present the mathematical background to properly understand the main contents presented in the next chapters.
  2. Chapter 3-4 present the theory behind the Black-Scholes model and present two ways to obtain the Black-Scholes formula using the Heat Equation or Martingales and the Girsanov theorem.
  3. Chapter 5 present simulations about the Discrete Case Scenario addressed using a Binomial Tree Model and Monte-Carlo Simulations.
  4. Chapter 6-7 present the reasons why the Heston Model is a better choice to evaluate Call/Put Options and introduce the theory behind the model.
  5. Chapter 8 present the Heston Model, then it introduce Euler and Milstein discretization schemes and finally, it contains some simulation and results of Call/Put Option Pricing.
